name: inno-research-orchestrator
description: Receives free-form user input about a research task, judges its maturity (plan vs idea), and constructs the standardized inputs needed by inno-prepare-resources. Use when the user wants to start a research pipeline — regardless of how complete or structured their input is.
---

# Inno Research Orchestrator

The user's entry point to the InnoFlow Research pipeline. Real users rarely provide a ready-made instance JSON with all fields filled. This skill bridges the gap between **what the user actually gives** and **what inno-prepare-resources expects**.

## When to use

- User says "start research", "run experiment", "help me implement a paper", etc.
- User provides any combination of: topic text, paper link, background, plan, JSON file, or reference papers.

## Constraints

- **Sandbox rule**: The agent must **only** read, write, and create files inside the current project directory (`<project_path>`). Never access, reference, or modify files outside this directory. Path values in `instance.json` are **absolute** when the project is created by Vibe Lab; use them as-is for file I/O. If an instance uses relative paths (e.g. hand-edited), resolve with `path.join(project_path, value)`. All generated paths (e.g. `instance`, `Ideation.references`, `Ideation.ideas`, `Experiment.code_references`, `Experiment.datasets`, `Experiment.core_code`, `Experiment.analysis`, `Publication.paper`, symlinks, dataset copies, etc.) must be children of `<project_path>`. If the user mentions an external path (e.g. a dataset), copy or symlink it **into** the project directory rather than operating on it in-place.

---

## Step 1 — Collect and understand user input

Users may provide input in **any** of the forms below. Gather as much as possible before proceeding.

| User provides | What you get |
|---------------|-------------|
| A topic sentence, e.g. "I want to improve biomedical QA" | `task_instructions` (background) |
| Reference paper titles or URLs | `source_papers` entries (agent fetches metadata from URLs) |
| A background paragraph / problem description | `task_instructions` (= `task2`) |
| A full implementation plan (method + data + training + eval) | `ideas` (= `task1`) |
| An instance JSON file path | All fields directly |
| A dataset name, URL, or local path | Dataset information for `dataset_description` |

**If critical information is missing, ask the user.** Minimum required:
- Some form of task description (topic, background, or problem statement)
- The user's project working directory (or use the current VibeLab project path)

---

## Step 2 — Judge maturity level

Based on what the user provided, classify into **plan-level** or **idea-level**:

| Level | Signal | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Plan-level** | User provided a detailed implementation plan with method, data processing, model architecture, training procedure, evaluation metrics. Or an instance JSON with a substantial `task1`. | Skip idea generation. Set `ideas = plan text`. Set `task_level = "task1"`. |
| **Idea-level** | User provided only a topic, background, problem description, or paper without a concrete plan. Or an instance JSON with `task2` only / no `task1`. | Ideas will be generated. Set `task_level = "task2"`. |

**Heuristic**: If the user's text mentions specific model components, loss functions, training steps, and evaluation metrics → plan. If it only describes the problem domain or desired outcome → idea.

---

## Step 3 — Construct standardized inputs for inno-prepare-resources

`inno-prepare-resources` expects paths and fields from **`instance.json`**. When the project is created by Vibe Lab, `instance` and `Ideation.*` / `Experiment.*` / `Publication.*` are **absolute** paths; use as-is. If relative (e.g. hand-edited instance), resolve with `path.join(project_path, value)`.

```
instance            : str   — path to instance file (absolute in Vibe Lab: <project_path>/instance.json)
idea_maturity       : str   — "task1" (plan) or "task2" (idea), or use task_level in load_instance cache
category            : str   — research domain tag, agent-inferred (may match a built-in metaprompt or be "custom")
Ideation.references : str   — path to Ideation/references (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Ideation.ideas      : str   — path to Ideation/ideas (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Experiment.code_references : str — path (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Experiment.datasets : str   — path (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Experiment.core_code: str   — path (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Experiment.analysis : str   — path (absolute in Vibe Lab)
Publication.paper   : str   — path (absolute in Vibe Lab)
references          : str   — formatted string from source_papers (built by the pipeline)
ideas               : str   — (optional, plan-mode only) the user's full plan text
```

### 3a — Build or locate the instance JSON

**Case A: User provided an instance JSON file path**
→ Use directly. Read the file, verify it has `source_papers` and at least one of `task1` / `task2`.

**Case B: User provided some information (topic, papers, plan, etc.) but no JSON file**
→ The agent must **construct** an instance JSON from whatever the user gave. Do **not** ask the user for fields like `rank`, `type`, `justification`, `usage`, `abstract`, or `url` — the agent should fill these in automatically or leave them with sensible defaults.

Construction rules:

1. **`source_papers`**: The user may mention related work as paper titles or URLs.
   - If the user gave paper titles → add each as `{"reference": "<title>"}`.
   - If the user gave paper URLs (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, etc.) → the agent fetches the paper title from the URL and adds it as a `source_papers` entry. These URLs are references to **related work**, not the user's own paper.
   - Fields like `rank`, `type`, `justification`, `usage` are **auto-generated by the agent** based on the paper's role in the research context, or left empty — they are only informational for downstream prompts.
   - If the user gave no papers at all → `source_papers = []`. The Prepare Agent and GitHub search will find relevant code based on the task description.

2. **`task2`** (idea-level): The user's background text, problem description, or topic sentence. If the user only gave a short topic, expand it by asking a brief clarifying question or use it as-is.

3. **`task1`** (plan-level): The user's detailed plan. Only present when maturity = plan.

4. **`instance_id`**: Auto-generate, e.g. `user_<topic_slug>_001`.

Minimal valid instance JSON (the bare minimum the pipeline needs):
```json
{
  "source_papers": [],
  "task2": "<user's task description>",
  "instance_id": "user_research_001"
}
```

Save this JSON to **`<project_path>/instance.json`** (project root). When created by Vibe Lab, the `instance` field and all path fields are absolute; hand-edited instances may use relative paths.

### 3b — Determine category and prepare dataset

#### Category (agent-inferred)

The `category` is an internal tag the **agent determines automatically** from the user's task description. The user does not need to know or provide it.

If the category matches a built-in one, the pipeline can use a pre-written `metaprompt.py` that provides `TASK`, `DATASET`, `BASELINE`, `COMPARISON`, and `EVALUATION` prompts. If not, the agent builds these from conversation.

Built-in categories (for reference):
```
cls, ecgcls, ecgprognosis, ehr_recom, ehr_riskpre, mmfusion,
mm_report_gen, nlp_qa, nlp_risk_pre, nlp_sum, prognosis,
registration, restoration, seg, videoassess, videocvs,
videoflow, videorestoration, videoseg
```

**How the agent infers category:**
1. Instance JSON path contains a category name (e.g. `.../nlp_qa/nlp_qa_1.json`) → extract.
2. Match keywords from user's description:
   - "question answering", "QA", "BioASQ" → `nlp_qa`
   - "segmentation" → `seg`
   - "classification" → `cls`
   - "summarization" → `nlp_sum`
   - "ECG" → `ecgcls` / `ecgprognosis`
   - "EHR", "risk prediction" → `ehr_riskpre`
   - "recommendation" → `ehr_recom`
   - "report generation" → `mm_report_gen`
   - "registration" → `registration`
   - "restoration" → `restoration`
   - "video segmentation" → `videoseg`
3. No match → set `category = "custom"` (see dataset section below).

#### Dataset preparation

Users will **not** have the `dataset_candidate/{category}/` directory pre-populated. The agent must help acquire and set up the dataset. Handle each scenario:

**Scenario 1 — Built-in category with pre-existing dataset**
The `metaprompt.py` already describes where dataset files should be (e.g. `Experiment/datasets/bioasq/`). Check if these files already exist in the workspace. If yes, proceed. If not, the agent should either:
- Download them (if a public URL is known from the metaprompt), or
- Ask the user where the data is (see Scenario 3/4).

**Scenario 2 — Built-in category, but user has dataset elsewhere**
User says "my BioASQ data is at `/home/dingjie/data/bioasq/`".
→ Create a symlink or copy the data into `Experiment/datasets/{category}/`, or instruct downstream skills to read from the user's path directly. Update the `dataset_description` accordingly.

**Scenario 3 — User provides a dataset URL**
User says "download the data from https://example.com/dataset.zip".
→ The agent downloads it to `Experiment/datasets/`, extracts if needed, and explores the contents to understand the data format. Then builds a `dataset_description` manually.

**Scenario 4 — User points to a local directory**
User says "my dataset is at `/home/dingjie/workspace/my_data/`".
→ The agent reads/explores that directory to understand the file structure, data format, and schema. Build `dataset_description` from what is found. Symlink or reference the path in the workspace.

**Scenario 5 — User describes data but doesn't provide it**
User says "I'm working with chest X-ray images and radiology reports".
→ Ask the user to either provide the data path/URL or indicate if the agent should search for a public dataset. If no data is available yet, the pipeline can still proceed through idea-generation and planning stages — actual data is only needed at the ml-dev step.

**Scenario 6 — Custom / unknown category**
Set `category = "custom"`. There is no `metaprompt.py` for this category. The agent must build the equivalent information through conversation:
- **TASK**: What is the task? (e.g. "Predict hospital readmission from EHR data")
- **DATASET**: What format is the data in? (CSV, JSON, images, etc.) Where is it located?
- **BASELINE**: What are known baseline methods and their performance?
- **EVALUATION**: What metrics to use? (accuracy, F1, AUC, BLEU, etc.)

Compose these into a `dataset_description` string and pass it to `inno-prepare-resources` in place of the one that would normally come from `metaprompt.py`.

### 3c — Set up workspace paths, directories, and write required output files

#### Path layout

The pipeline outputs are organized into three semantic top-level folders. **Vibe Lab creates these preset directories on project creation**: Ideation/ideas, Ideation/references, Experiment/code_references, datasets, core_code, analysis, Publication/paper, Publication/homepage, Publication/slide. The orchestrator only needs to create `logs/` subdirs when writing caches. Paths in `instance.json` are **absolute** when created by Vibe Lab; use as-is, or resolve with `path.join(project_path, value)` if relative.

```
project_path              = <current VibeLab project path>
Ideation.references       = <project_path>/Ideation/references
Ideation.ideas            = <project_path>/Ideation/ideas
Experiment.code_references= <project_path>/Experiment/code_references
Experiment.datasets       = <project_path>/Experiment/datasets
Experiment.core_code      = <project_path>/Experiment/core_code
Experiment.analysis        = <project_path>/Experiment/analysis
Publication.paper         = <project_path>/Publication/paper
Publication.homepage      = <project_path>/Publication/homepage
Publication.slide         = <project_path>/Publication/slide
```

If the user has an existing workspace directory, use it. Otherwise, create any missing directories. **Vibe Lab–created projects already have** instance.json and the preset dirs below; create only `logs/` subdirs when writing caches.

```
<project_path>/
├── instance.json                          ← project root (Research Lab UI; paths absolute in Vibe Lab)
├── Ideation/
│   ├── references/
│   │   ├── papers/                        ← arXiv downloaded papers
│   │   └── logs/                          ← prepare_agent.json, github_search.json,
│   │                                         load_instance.json, download_arxiv*.json
│   └── ideas/
│       └── logs/                          ← idea_generation_agent*.json
├── Experiment/
│   ├── code_references/
│   │   └── logs/                          ← repo_acquisition_agent.json, code_survey_agent.json
│   ├── datasets/
│   ├── core_code/
│   │   └── logs/                          ← coding_plan_agent.json, machine_learning_agent*.json,
│   │                                         judge_agent*.json
│   └── analysis/
│       └── logs/                          ← experiment_analysis_agent*.json
└── Publication/
    ├── paper/
    ├── homepage/
    └── slide/
```

Create any missing directories and `logs/` subdirectories when writing caches.

#### Required output file at project root

The **Research Lab** UI reads **`instance.json`** from the project root. When **Vibe Lab creates a project**, it already writes this file and the preset dirs; paths are **absolute** (e.g. `<project_path>/Ideation/ideas`). The orchestrator **must** write or update instance.json when constructing from user input so the dashboard can display research status. Paths may be absolute (Vibe Lab default) or relative (hand-edited).

**`instance.json`** must contain at least (paths absolute when created by Vibe Lab):

```json
{
  "instance_id": "<generated id>",
  "idea_maturity": "task1 or task2",
  "created_at": "<ISO date>",
  "instance": "<project_path>/instance.json",
  "category": "<inferred category>",
  "Ideation": {
    "ideas": "<project_path>/Ideation/ideas",
    "references": "<project_path>/Ideation/references"
  },
  "Experiment": {
    "code_references": "<project_path>/Experiment/code_references",
    "datasets": "<project_path>/Experiment/datasets",
    "core_code": "<project_path>/Experiment/core_code",
    "analysis": "<project_path>/Experiment/analysis"
  },
  "Publication": {
    "paper": "<project_path>/Publication/paper",
    "homepage": "<project_path>/Publication/homepage",
    "slide": "<project_path>/Publication/slide"
  }
}
```

Include any instance-level fields (e.g. `source_papers`, `task2`/`task1`) at top level as needed by downstream skills. The `references` and `ideas` content strings are filled later by the prepare step; path keys above are directories (absolute in Vibe Lab–created projects).

#### Cache seed file: `load_instance.json`

After constructing or locating the instance JSON, write the load result so downstream skills can reference it. This file follows the standard tool cache format:

```json
{
  "name": "load_instance",
  "args": {
    "instance_path": "<absolute path: path.join(project_path, instance.instance)>",
    "task_level": "task1 or task2"
  },
  "result": {
    "source_papers": [ ... ],
    "task_instructions": "<task description text>",
    "date_limit": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

- `result.source_papers` — the full `source_papers` array from the instance
- `result.task_instructions` — the text from the field indicated by `task_level` (`task1` or `task2`)
- `result.date_limit` — publication date fetched from arXiv, or default `"2024-01-01"` if unavailable

**Save** → `Ideation/references/logs/load_instance.json`

All files (`instance.json`, `Ideation/references/logs/load_instance.json`) must be written **before** the orchestrator presents the summary to the user.

---

## Step 4 — Output summary and wait for user confirmation

**Do NOT automatically invoke inno-prepare-resources or any downstream skill.** Instead, present a summary of the prepared inputs to the user and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

The summary should include:

1. **Maturity judgment**: Plan-level or Idea-level (and why)
2. **Instance JSON**: file path and key contents (`source_papers` count, `task_level`, `instance_id`)
3. **Category**: the inferred category and whether a built-in metaprompt is available
4. **Dataset**: status (found / needs download / user-provided / custom description built)
5. **Workspace paths**: `Ideation/`, `Experiment/`, `Publication/`
6. **Next step**: which skill to run next — **inno-prepare-resources** — and the arguments it will receive

Also remind the user of the full pipeline that will follow:

**Plan-level pipeline:**
1. inno-prepare-resources (with `ideas`)
2. inno-code-survey
3. inno-experiment-dev (plan + implement + judge + submit)
4. inno-experiment-analysis (analyse + refine)
5. inno-paper-writing (draft publication-ready paper, including framework figure generation via Nanobanana SOP + Gemini CLI rendering) — optional, user-triggered

**Idea-level pipeline:**
1. inno-prepare-resources
2. inno-idea-generation
3. inno-idea-eval (quality gate: multi-persona evaluation)
4. inno-code-survey (Phase A: repo acquisition + Phase B: code survey)
5. inno-experiment-dev (plan + implement + judge + submit)
6. inno-experiment-analysis (analyse + refine)
7. inno-paper-writing (draft publication-ready paper, including framework figure generation via Nanobanana SOP + Gemini CLI rendering) — optional, user-triggered

The user may then say "proceed", "run prepare", or manually invoke `inno-prepare-resources`.

## Examples

### Example 1 — User gives only a topic

> User: "I want to do research on biomedical question answering using neural networks."

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Maturity: only a topic → **idea-level**, `task_level = "task2"`
2. No papers provided → `source_papers = []`
3. Agent infers category → keyword "question answering" → `nlp_qa`
4. Dataset: check if `nlp_qa` metaprompt data (BioASQ) exists in workspace; if not, ask user "Do you have BioASQ data locally, or should I help you download it?"
5. Construct minimal instance JSON: `{"source_papers": [], "task2": "...", "instance_id": "user_bioasq_qa_001"}`
6. Set up workspace paths, present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step

### Example 2 — User gives related-work paper URLs + background

> User: "I want to improve factoid QA for the BioASQ challenge. Here are some related papers: http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08568v1, http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603"

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Agent fetches paper titles from arXiv URLs → adds to `source_papers` as related work
2. Maturity: background only → **idea-level**
3. Construct instance JSON: `{"source_papers": [{"reference": "Neural Question Answering at BioASQ 5B"}, {"reference": "..."}], "task2": "I want to improve factoid QA...", "instance_id": "user_bioasq_qa_002"}`
4. Agent infers category → "BioASQ", "factoid QA" → `nlp_qa`
5. Dataset: agent checks workspace for BioASQ data
6. Present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step

### Example 3 — User gives a full plan

> User: "Use a BiLSTM+BiDAF encoder with Sinkhorn-normalized 2D span scoring. Train with Adam (lr=2e-3) on BioASQ factoid QA, evaluate with SAcc/LAcc/MRR. Pre-train on SQuAD then fine-tune on BioASQ. [detailed method...]"

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Maturity: has model architecture, optimizer, metrics → **plan-level**, `task_level = "task1"`
2. `ideas` = user's full plan text
3. Agent infers category → "BioASQ" → `nlp_qa`
4. Construct instance JSON with `task1` = plan text
5. Present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step (plan branch)

### Example 4 — User gives an instance JSON path

> User: "Run the pipeline on `/home/dingjie/.../nlp_qa/nlp_qa_1.json` with task2."

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Read instance from provided path (resolve relative to project if needed); use as `instance` and paths from it
2. `task_level = "task2"` → **idea-level**
3. Agent infers category from path → `nlp_qa`
4. Present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step

### Example 5 — User has their own dataset and topic

> User: "I want to predict hospital readmission from EHR data. My dataset is at /home/dingjie/data/mimic_readmission/ in CSV format."

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Maturity: only task description → **idea-level**
2. Agent infers category: "EHR", "readmission", "risk prediction" → try `ehr_riskpre`. If doesn't match well → `category = "custom"`
3. Dataset: agent explores `/home/dingjie/data/mimic_readmission/` to understand file structure and data schema
4. Agent builds `dataset_description` from the exploration (CSV columns, sample counts, target variable, etc.)
5. Construct instance JSON with `task2`, `source_papers = []`
6. Present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step (idea branch)

### Example 6 — User gives a dataset URL

> User: "I'm working on medical image segmentation. You can get the dataset from https://example.com/cardiac_seg.zip"

**Orchestrator actions:**
1. Maturity → **idea-level**
2. Agent infers category → "segmentation" → `seg`
3. Dataset: agent downloads the zip to workspace, extracts, explores contents
4. Agent builds `dataset_description` from found files (image formats, mask formats, train/test split, etc.)
5. Construct instance JSON, present summary to user, wait for confirmation before next step
